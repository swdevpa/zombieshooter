# Score System and Wave Indicators

## Description
Implement a comprehensive scoring system and wave indicators to provide better game feedback and progression tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a score system that awards points for various player actions
- [x] Implement a score multiplier system that increases with consecutive kills
- [x] Add visual feedback for score events with animated popups
- [x] Display current wave number and provide clear wave transitions
- [x] Implement high score tracking and persistence
- [x] Add statistics tracking for game performance

## Technical Implementation
- Created a modular `ScoreManager` class to handle all scoring logic
- Implemented score multiplier system with decay over time
- Added visual feedback with score popups that appear at kill locations
- Enhanced wave transition system with animated announcements
- Implemented statistics tracking for various gameplay metrics
- Added high score persistence using localStorage

## Tasks
1. [x] Create ScoreManager class
2. [x] Update UI to display score, multiplier, and wave information
3. [x] Integrate ScoreManager with ZombieManager for zombie kills
4. [x] Implement wave completion bonuses
5. [x] Add visual feedback for score events
6. [x] Implement high score persistence
7. [x] Enhance GameStateManager to display final score

## Developer Notes
- Implemented a comprehensive score system with points for different zombie types and headshots
- Added a score multiplier system that increases with consecutive kills and resets when taking damage
- Created animated score popups that appear in 3D space and are projected to screen coordinates
- Implemented high score tracking with localStorage persistence and a notification when beating high score
- Enhanced wave indicators with animated wave announcements and subtitles
- Added statistical tracking for accuracy, kills by type, and other gameplay metrics
- Integrated with existing systems (ZombieManager, UiManager, GameStateManager) for seamless operation
- Visual feedback includes score popups, multiplier color changes, and wave transition effects

The score system provides meaningful feedback to the player and encourages skilled play through the multiplier system. It's fully integrated with the existing components and enhances the game experience with visual feedback and progression tracking.
