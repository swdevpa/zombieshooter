# Story: Implement level boundaries and collision

## Status: DONE

## Description
Implement proper level boundaries for the game world to prevent players from leaving the playable area. These boundaries should appear as physical barriers in the game world and should have proper collision detection to prevent the player from passing through them.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create physical boundary objects around the perimeter of the city
- [x] Implement collision detection for these boundary objects
- [x] Boundaries should be visible and fit aesthetically with the apocalyptic city theme
- [x] Add visual feedback when player approaches or collides with a boundary
- [x] Ensure boundary size is appropriate for the city size defined in LevelManager
- [x] Performance optimized boundary rendering using instanced meshes
- [x] Integrate with existing player collision system
- [x] Add an option to toggle boundary visibility for debugging

## Developer Notes
Implemented a comprehensive level boundary system that creates physical barriers around the perimeter of the city:

1. **Created LevelBoundary Class**:
   - Developed a modular LevelBoundary class that handles generation of boundary walls, corner posts and warning decorations
   - Used instanced meshes for optimal performance when rendering multiple wall segments
   - Implemented color-coded warning stripes that provide visual feedback when approaching boundaries

2. **Collision System Integration**:
   - Added robust collision detection for boundary objects using Box3 and Sphere intersection tests
   - Integrated with the existing player collision system through the city's checkComponentCollision method
   - Implemented proximity detection to provide visual feedback when player approaches boundaries

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Added warning stripes on the walls that increase in brightness when the player approaches
   - Created corner posts at the four corners of the boundary for additional visual clarity
   - Designed boundaries to fit with the apocalyptic theme using appropriate materials and colors

4. **Debugging Features**:
   - Added toggle controls with B key to show/hide boundaries for debugging
   - Implemented debug visualization mode (Shift+B) to show collision boxes
   - Created fallback rendering method for systems that don't support instanced meshes

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Used THREE.InstancedMesh for efficient rendering of wall segments
   - Implemented optimized collision detection using Box3 objects
   - Added visibility culling to only check collisions when boundaries are visible

6. **Code Integration**:
   - Integrated the LevelBoundary class with the City class for seamless generation
   - Added boundary generation to the city generation pipeline
   - Implemented proper resource disposal for memory management

The level boundaries now effectively prevent players from leaving the game area while maintaining the aesthetic of the game world and providing appropriate visual feedback. Players can toggle boundary visibility for testing purposes.
