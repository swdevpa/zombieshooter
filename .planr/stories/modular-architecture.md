# Modular Architecture

## User Story
As a game developer, I want a modular and organized code architecture to make the game easier to maintain and extend as new features are added.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Establish a clear separation of concerns between different game components
- [x] Create manager classes to handle specific responsibilities
- [x] Ensure components can communicate without tight coupling
- [x] Implement proper initialization and update cycles
- [x] Organize code in logical directory structure

## Implementation Details
- Created a UiManager class to handle all UI-related operations
- Implemented a LevelManager class to handle level loading and management
- Fixed missing file dependencies in the game architecture
- Integrated managers into the game's initialization and update cycle
- Ensured managers follow a consistent API pattern
- Used dependency injection to reduce coupling between components

## Developer Notes
- UiManager was implemented as a wrapper around the existing UI class to provide a cleaner API and single point of contact for UI operations.
- LevelManager was created to handle level loading, configuration, and progression.
- Both managers follow a consistent pattern with init() and update() methods.
- The Game class was updated to properly initialize and use these managers.
- Fixed linting issues in the new files to maintain code quality.
- Fixed a critical initialization error where the Game constructor was not receiving a proper DOM container element.
- Added a dedicated game-container div to the HTML file to ensure proper rendering.
- Fixed initialization order issue where camera and objects were being accessed before they were created.
- Improved UI initialization to ensure UI components don't try to access player properties before the player is created.
- Made the UI code more defensive by adding null checks and default values to handle the case when the player or weapon doesn't exist yet.
- Added missing methods to UiManager (updateFPS, showPauseMenu, hidePauseMenu, showGameOverMenu).
- Enhanced City class to properly work with LevelManager by adding cityGroup property and getPlayerStartPosition method.
- Added proper configuration handling to City class to accept parameters from LevelManager.
- This architecture will make it easier to add new features like weapon systems, different enemy types, and more complex UI elements in the future.
