## Developer Notes

Fixed critical errors in the building generation system:

1. Added missing `createBalconies` method to BuildingGenerator.js
   - Implemented a method to create realistic balconies for residential buildings
   - Includes railing details and random placement on building sides

2. Added missing `getRandomColorFromPalette` method to TexturingSystem.js
   - Implemented color palette selection function for building materials
   - Converts hex color string to THREE.js color format

3. Fixed Object3D error in City.js
   - Modified createBuildings method to add building.container to the scene instead of the building object itself
   - The building object was not a THREE.Object3D instance, but contains one in its container property

These changes resolve the primary errors shown in the console:
- "this.createBalconies is not a function" in BuildingGenerator.js
- "this.getRandomColorFromPalette is not a function" in TexturingSystem.js
- "THREE.Object3D.add: object not an instance of THREE.Object3D" in City.js

The game should now be able to generate buildings without the previous errors.
