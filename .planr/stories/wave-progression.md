# Wave Progression System

## Story: Implement wave progression system for zombie waves

### Description
Implement a comprehensive wave progression system that increases difficulty as players advance through waves. The system should manage zombie types, spawn rates, and special wave events to create an increasingly challenging experience.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a progressive difficulty curve that scales with wave number
- Create special "boss waves" at regular intervals with more difficult zombies
- Add wave bonuses and rewards for players (health, ammo, score)
- Implement wave transition effects and announcements
- Track and display wave statistics (zombies killed, time taken)
- Add variety to waves with different zombie type distributions
- Include special wave modifiers (fast zombies, tank zombies, etc.)
- Balance difficulty progression for a challenging but fair experience

### Technical Requirements
- Extend ZombieManager to handle wave progression logic
- Implement proper integration with Game state system
- Create configurable difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard)
- Ensure proper memory management and performance optimization

### Developer Notes
Implemented a comprehensive wave progression system with the following features:

1. **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**:
   - Enhanced zombie count calculation with wave-based scaling
   - Implemented difficulty multipliers (easy: 0.7, normal: 1.0, hard: 1.4)
   - Added setDifficulty method to adjust zombie counts and difficulty levels

2. **Boss Wave System**:
   - Added boss waves every 5 waves with special modifiers
   - Created boss wave-specific visual effects and UI announcements
   - Implemented longer transition times after boss waves (10 seconds vs 5 seconds)
   - Added special rewards after boss wave completion (health packs, ammo)

3. **Wave Modifiers**:
   - Implemented 5 different wave modifiers that affect zombie behavior:
     - 'fast': Zombies move 50% faster
     - 'tough': Zombies have 50% more health
     - 'horde': Double zombie spawn count
     - 'healing': Zombies slowly regenerate health
     - 'explosive': Zombies explode on death, damaging nearby entities

4. **Statistics Tracking**:
   - Added comprehensive wave statistics tracking
   - Stored zombies spawned/killed, time taken, and modifiers for each wave
   - Implemented game completion screen showing total statistics

5. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Created special boss wave announcement with pulsing effects
   - Added wave modifier information to wave announcements
   - Implemented victory screen with game statistics when all waves completed

6. **ZombieFactory Integration**:
   - Extended ZombieFactory with getBossWaveZombieTypes method
   - Implemented specialized zombie type distribution based on boss wave number

7. **Zombie Enhancements**:
   - Added support for health regeneration
   - Implemented explosion effects for special zombie types
   - Created recordZombieKill method for tracking zombie deaths

The system provides increasing challenge while maintaining fair difficulty progression and introducing variety to gameplay through different wave types and modifiers. The code maintains modularity by properly separating concerns between the ZombieManager, ZombieFactory, and UI components.
