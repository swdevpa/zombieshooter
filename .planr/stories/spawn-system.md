# Story: Zombie Spawn System

## Description
Create a comprehensive system for spawning zombies during gameplay that progressively scales with wave difficulty.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a wave-based spawn system that increases in difficulty
- Create spawn points at the edges of the city map
- Add different spawn strategies (groups, random locations, timed waves)
- Implement a spawn director to control the flow of zombies based on player performance
- Ensure zombies spawn at valid locations with paths to the player
- Implement visual indicators when new waves start
- Scale zombie types based on wave number (more difficult zombies in later waves)

## Technical Notes
- Integrate with existing ZombieManager class
- Build on existing determineSpawnPoints() and validateSpawnPoints() methods
- Implement spawnZombies() method to handle the actual spawning
- Create a wave progression system that increases difficulty over time
- Ensure the system is optimized for performance with many zombies
- Add debug visualization options for spawn points

## Developer Notes
- Implemented a comprehensive wave-based zombie spawn system that progressively increases in difficulty.
- Created a wave controller that dynamically adjusts the spawn rate based on wave number and player performance.
- Replaced the batch spawning method with a controlled sequential spawn approach using spawnNextZombie().
- Added visual feedback systems including wave announcements with dynamic subtitles, wave completion messages, and bonus score notifications.
- Implemented spawn effects with particle systems at zombie spawn locations for visual feedback.
- Created adaptive wave difficulty scaling that increases zombie count, types, and spawn rate based on wave progression.
- Added intelligent spawn timing that adjusts based on current zombie count and wave number.
- Enhanced UI system with message displays for wave start, wave completion, and bonus awards.
- Used ZombieFactory's type distribution system to gradually introduce more difficult zombies in later waves.
- Optimized wave transitions with appropriate delays between waves to create gameplay pacing.
