# Environment Texturing System

## Story ID
texturing-system

## Status
done

## Description
Implementation of a comprehensive environment texturing system for buildings, streets, and city components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a dedicated texturing system class
- [x] Add procedural texture generation for various building materials
- [x] Implement normal maps for realistic surface detail
- [x] Create a material system that supports different building types and destruction levels
- [x] Integrate with performance settings to adjust texture quality
- [x] Ensure proper memory management with texture disposal

## Implementation Details
A comprehensive texturing system has been implemented with the following components:

1. `TexturingSystem.js` - A new class that manages all environment textures and PBR materials with the following features:
   - Material caching for different building types and destruction levels
   - Support for different texture quality settings (low, medium, high)
   - PBR material parameters for various surfaces (roughness, metalness, etc.)
   - Memory management with proper disposal methods

2. Added new texture generation methods to `AssetLoader.js`:
   - Building wall textures
   - Building wall normal maps
   - Building glass textures
   - Concrete wall textures and normal maps
   - Metal wall textures and normal maps
   - Asphalt textures and normal maps
   - Utility method for adding noise to textures

3. Updated `BuildingGenerator.js` to use the texturing system:
   - Integrated with TexturingSystem for material creation
   - Maintained backward compatibility with fallback materials

4. Updated `CityComponents.js` to use the texturing system:
   - Integrated with TexturingSystem for city component materials
   - Maintained backward compatibility with fallback materials

5. Updated `Game.js` to initialize and use the texturing system:
   - Added TexturingSystem initialization
   - Updated quality settings to adjust texture quality

## Developer Notes
The texturing system significantly enhances the visual quality of the game world by providing realistic materials for buildings and city components. Key enhancements include:

1. **PBR Materials**: Implemented physically-based rendering materials with proper roughness and metalness properties for more realistic lighting.

2. **Normal Maps**: Added normal maps for all major textures to provide surface detail without increasing geometry complexity.

3. **Destruction Levels**: Materials account for building destruction levels, darkening and increasing roughness as destruction increases.

4. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Implemented a quality settings system that adjusts texture filtering based on performance requirements
   - Used material caching to reduce memory usage and GPU state changes
   - Created a proper disposal system to free GPU memory when textures are no longer needed

5. **Procedural Generation**: All textures are generated procedurally rather than loaded from files, which allows for:
   - Dynamic customization of textures
   - Reduced loading time and bandwidth requirements
   - Variation through random generation

The texturing system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new texture types and materials in the future.
