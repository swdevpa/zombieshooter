# Story: Create apocalyptic city assets procedurally

## Status: DONE

## Description
Implement a system to procedurally generate apocalyptic assets throughout the city to enhance the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. These assets should include various environmental details that make the world feel abandoned and dangerous.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a new ApocalypticAssets class that integrates with the city generation system
- [x] Implement procedural generation for barricades (wooden planks, metal sheets)
- [x] Add gore effects (blood pools, body parts) scattered throughout the environment
- [x] Generate building wreckage and debris piles with varied sizes and compositions
- [x] Create military checkpoint elements (barriers, crates, sandbags)
- [x] Add overgrown foliage elements (weeds, ivy) to show nature reclaiming the city
- [x] Implement fire and smoke effects with animation for dynamic atmosphere
- [x] Ensure proper collision detection for all generated assets
- [x] Use instanced meshes for optimal performance
- [x] Update the TexturingSystem to support apocalyptic materials

## Developer Notes
- Created ApocalypticAssets.js class with modular structure for different asset categories
- Used instanced meshes for all repetitive elements for optimal performance
- Implemented custom materials for each asset type with proper PBR settings
- Added collision detection for objects to ensure proper player interaction
- Created animated fire effects with dynamic color changes for realism
- Integrated apocalyptic assets generation into the city generation pipeline
- Updated the TexturingSystem to include dedicated methods for apocalyptic materials
- Modified City.js to instantiate and manage the ApocalypticAssets class
- Implemented proper resource management with dispose() methods to prevent memory leaks
- Added methods to check for asset placement relative to buildings and streets
- Implemented environmental storytelling through strategic placement of assets
- Used efficient Matrix4 manipulation for instanced mesh positioning and rotation
- Updated the collision detection system to handle apocalyptic assets
