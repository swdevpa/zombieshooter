# Visual Effects Enhancement

## Story ID
visual-effects

## Description
Enhance the visual effects system to create more immersive and satisfying combat feedback, including improved muzzle flashes, blood effects, and impact visuals.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a centralized EffectsManager class to handle all visual effects
- [ ] Implement enhanced muzzle flash effects with dynamic lighting and particles
- [ ] Add realistic blood splatter effects with proper physics and surface interaction
- [ ] Create detailed impact effects for different surface types (metal, concrete, wood)
- [ ] Add bullet trail effects with proper lighting and fade
- [ ] Implement screen shake and camera effects for weapon recoil
- [ ] Add particle effects for zombie death and dismemberment
- [ ] Create environmental effects (smoke, dust, debris) for impacts
- [ ] Optimize effects for performance using object pooling
- [ ] Add quality settings for effects based on hardware capability

## Technical Notes
- Build on existing effects in Weapon.js and Zombie.js
- Use Three.js particle systems for efficient effects
- Implement proper cleanup and disposal of effects
- Consider performance impact of multiple simultaneous effects
- Use object pooling for frequently created effects

## Dependencies
- Weapon system
- Zombie system
- RenderManager
- Performance monitoring system

## Developer Notes
The implementation will focus on creating a comprehensive visual effects system that enhances the game's combat feedback while maintaining good performance. The EffectsManager will centralize all effect creation and management, making it easier to maintain and optimize effects across the game.
