# Animation Refinement

## Description
Refine and polish all animations in the game to ensure smooth transitions and natural movement for both player and zombie characters.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Player Animations
- [ ] Smooth weapon transitions when switching between weapons
- [ ] Natural head bobbing during movement
- [ ] Improved reload animations with proper timing and visual feedback
- [ ] Enhanced weapon sway during movement and shooting
- [ ] Smooth camera transitions when taking damage or healing

### Zombie Animations
- [ ] Fluid transitions between zombie states (idle, walking, running, attacking)
- [ ] Improved death animations with ragdoll physics
- [ ] Enhanced hit reactions based on damage location
- [ ] Smooth transitions for special zombie abilities
- [ ] Natural-looking zombie movement patterns

### Environmental Animations
- [ ] Smooth particle effects for blood, muzzle flash, and impacts
- [ ] Improved building destruction animations
- [ ] Enhanced environmental effects (smoke, fire, debris)
- [ ] Smooth transitions for weather effects
- [ ] Natural-looking foliage movement

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement animation blending for smooth state transitions
- [ ] Add animation event system for sound and effect triggers
- [ ] Optimize animation performance with proper culling
- [ ] Implement animation LOD system for distant objects
- [ ] Add debug visualization for animation states

## Notes
- Focus on maintaining performance while improving animation quality
- Ensure animations work well with the existing culling system
- Consider adding animation quality settings for different hardware
- Test animations across different zombie types and scenarios
- Verify smooth transitions in high-stress situations (many zombies, rapid weapon switching)
