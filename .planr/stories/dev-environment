# Development Environment Setup

## Description
Set up a robust development environment and build pipeline for the Zombie Wave Shooter project to ensure efficient development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Configure Vite.js for modern JavaScript development
- [x] Set up hot module reloading for efficient development
- [x] Implement proper asset loading pipeline
- [x] Configure ESLint for code quality
- [x] Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
- [x] Ensure proper handling of Three.js dependencies
- [x] Create build configuration for production deployment
- [x] Document the development workflow

## Implementation Notes
The development environment should support:
- Fast refreshing during development
- Proper module imports for Three.js and other libraries
- Asset management and optimization
- Code quality standards
- Efficient build process for production
