# Weapon Model Enhancement

## Description
Enhance the visual experience of the game by adding more detailed weapon models with proper animations. This includes creating more realistic 3D models for the weapons, adding animations for different weapon actions, and improving the visual feedback when interacting with weapons.

## Requirements
- Create more detailed 3D models for weapons using Three.js primitives
- Implement smooth animations for weapon actions (firing, reloading, idle)
- Ensure proper positioning in first-person view
- Add visual details like textures and materials
- Optimize models for performance
- Implement recoil effects and muzzle flash
- Create reload animations with multiple phases
- Add idle animations and weapon sway

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Detailed 3D model for the Pistol with proper components (barrel, slide, grip, etc.)
- [x] Smooth animations for firing, including slide movement
- [x] Multi-phase reload animation showing magazine removal and insertion
- [x] Proper positioning and scaling in first-person view
- [x] Weapon follows player camera movements with appropriate lag/smoothing
- [x] Idle animation with subtle movement
- [x] Visible moving parts during animations (slide, hammer, etc.)
- [x] Optimized performance with appropriate polygon count
- [x] Logical hierarchy of weapon parts for animations
- [x] Support for different weapon types in the future

## Developer Notes
Implementation completed by enhancing the Weapon base class and Pistol implementation with detailed models and animations:

### Base Weapon Class Enhancements:
- Added support for component-based weapon models with hierarchical structure
- Implemented animation state tracking for idle, shooting, and reloading
- Created comprehensive update system for maintaining animations
- Added methods for positioning weapons based on player's camera
- Implemented utilities for creation and cleanup of visual effects
- Enhanced raycasting for more accurate hit detection and feedback
- Established foundation for future weapon types with polymorphic behavior

### Pistol Implementation:
- Created detailed model with separate components:
  - Frame/body using BoxGeometry
  - Detailed slide with proper positioning
  - Cylindrical barrel with appropriate alignment
  - Grip with ergonomic shape
  - Trigger, hammer, and magazine components
  - Front and rear sights with notch
  - Ejection port on the slide
- Implemented realistic materials with different metallic and roughness properties
- Added comprehensive animations:
  - Subtle idle animation with small movement and rotation
  - Realistic shooting animation with slide movement and hammer action
  - Four-phase reload animation: tilt, magazine ejection, insertion, and chambering
  - Weapon recoil and recovery animations

### Bullet Enhancements:
- Improved bullet visuals with streak/tracer effects
- Added particle trail for more visible bullet paths
- Enhanced collision detection using continuous raycasting
- Implemented detailed impact effects for different surfaces
- Optimized with object pooling for better performance

This implementation significantly improves the visual quality and feedback of the weapon system while maintaining good performance. The detailed animations and visual effects provide a more immersive shooting experience, and the modular design allows for easy addition of new weapon types in the future. 

Verification: The work has been verified as complete. All acceptance criteria have been met. The implementation includes detailed weapon models with proper components, smooth animations for firing and reloading, appropriate positioning in first-person view, and responsive interactions with player movement. The modular architecture provides a solid foundation for adding more weapon types in the future.
