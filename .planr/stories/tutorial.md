## Status
in-progress

## Description
Implement an interactive in-game tutorial system that guides new players through the game's mechanics, controls, and objectives. The tutorial should be informative yet unobtrusive, provide clear instructions, and help players understand how to effectively play the zombie shooter game.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a TutorialManager class to handle tutorial state and progression
- [x] Implement interactive tutorial steps that guide players through:
  - Basic movement and controls
  - Weapon handling and reloading
  - Combat against zombies
  - Wave system and objectives
  - UI elements explanation
- [x] Add highlighting and indicators for relevant UI elements during tutorial
- [x] Provide visual cues to direct player attention to tutorial elements
- [x] Add option to skip tutorial for experienced players
- [x] Create tutorial trigger in main menu and option to replay from settings
- [x] Implement a standalone help/controls screen accessible during gameplay
- [x] Ensure tutorial works seamlessly with existing game systems
- [x] Add proper animations and transitions for tutorial elements

## Technical Notes
The tutorial system should be modular and non-intrusive to the main game code. It should observe player actions to progress through tutorial steps and provide contextual guidance. The system should use existing UI infrastructure where possible, but may add specialized tutorial UI components.

Key components:
1. TutorialManager class to coordinate tutorial flow and state
2. TutorialStep class to define individual tutorial steps
3. UI integration for displaying tutorial messages and highlights
4. Input detection to verify player has completed tutorial actions
5. Tutorial data structure to define tutorial sequence

## Implementation Details
The implementation should focus on guiding the player through a typical game start to provide essential information without overwhelming them. Tutorial should be closely integrated with GameStateManager to coordinate proper game state during tutorial mode.

## Developer Notes
Implemented a comprehensive tutorial system with the following components:

1. **TutorialManager Class**: Created a central manager for tutorial state and progression that seamlessly integrates with the existing game architecture. The manager handles tutorial steps, progress tracking, and UI elements.

2. **Interactive Tutorial Steps**: Implemented a step-by-step tutorial sequence that guides players through basic movement, looking around, shooting, reloading, and understanding game mechanics. Each step verifies player actions before progressing.

3. **UI Highlighting System**: Added a highlighting feature that draws player attention to relevant UI elements during appropriate tutorial steps, with smooth animations and visual cues.

4. **Help Screen**: Created a dedicated help screen accessible during gameplay via the pause menu or H key shortcut, providing comprehensive controls information and gameplay tips.

5. **Game Integration**: Integrated the tutorial with the GameStateManager to handle state transitions between menu, tutorial, and gameplay. Enhanced the Game.js start method to support tutorial mode.

6. **ZombieManager Integration**: Modified ZombieManager to support tutorial mode with limited zombie spawning for a controlled experience.

7. **Skip Functionality**: Added the ability to skip the tutorial at any point, providing flexibility for experienced players.

The tutorial system enhances player onboarding with an intuitive, step-by-step introduction to game mechanics while maintaining the atmospheric and immersive qualities of the game. The help screen offers a permanent reference for controls and tips even after the tutorial is completed.
