# Hit Indicators and Damage Feedback

## Objective
Implement intuitive hit indicators and visual feedback when player takes damage, to enhance gameplay immersion and provide critical information to the player.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Visual feedback when player is hit, indicating severity and direction of damage
- [x] Red screen flash effect that intensifies with damage amount
- [x] Vignette damage effect that appears around screen edges
- [x] Directional indicators showing where damage came from
- [x] Screen shake effect proportional to damage received
- [x] Proper integration with Player, UI and Damage systems

## Implementation Details
- Added damage indicator elements to HTML including vignette, flash, and direction indicators
- Created comprehensive CSS animations for damage effects
- Enhanced UI class with methods for various damage feedback:
  - `showDamageFlash()` - Shows a red flash overlay when taking damage
  - `showDamageVignette()` - Shows a red vignette around the screen edges
  - `showDamageDirectionIndicator()` - Shows an arrow pointing to damage source
  - `showDamageFeedback()` - Combines all effects with appropriate intensity
  - `addScreenShake()` - Adds camera shake effect based on damage severity
- Updated Player's `takeDamage()` method to calculate damage angle and trigger appropriate feedback
- Enhanced DamageManager to pass source position information when applying damage
- Implemented dynamic positioning of direction indicators based on the angle of incoming damage
- Added intensity scaling for effects based on damage amount relative to player health

## Technical Approach
- Used CSS animations for visual effects to optimize performance
- Implemented directional indicators using CSS transforms and clip-path
- Added camera position adjustments for screen shake effects
- Used DOM manipulation for creating/showing/hiding UI elements
- Implemented angle calculation between player and damage sources

## Developer Notes
Implemented a comprehensive damage feedback system with multiple visual elements that work together to provide clear information to the player. The system includes screen flash effects, vignette darkening, directional indicators that show where damage is coming from, and screen shake effects proportional to damage amount.

Enhanced the Player class to calculate angles between damage sources and the player, and updated the DamageManager to pass source position data. All effects can be tuned for intensity and duration, and multiple effects can be shown simultaneously for complex feedback scenarios.
