## Status
done

## Description
Implementation of atmospheric effects including fog, lighting, and particle systems to create an apocalyptic city environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement dynamic fog system with customizable density
- [x] Add realistic lighting with support for different times of day
- [x] Create flickering light effects for apocalyptic atmosphere
- [x] Add dust particle system to enhance atmosphere
- [x] Support different quality levels for performance optimization
- [x] Ensure proper resource disposal for memory management

## Implementation Details
A comprehensive atmospheric effects system has been implemented with the following components:

1. `AtmosphericEffects.js` - A new class that manages all atmospheric effects with the following features:
   - Exponential fog system with configurable density and color
   - Time of day presets (dawn, day, dusk, night) that affect lighting and colors
   - Dynamic lighting system with subtle flickering effects
   - Dust particle system that creates floating dust particles for atmosphere
   - Performance optimization based on quality settings
   - Proper resource management with dispose methods

2. Integration with Game.js:
   - Removed static lighting setup and replaced with dynamic atmospheric effects
   - Added initialization in the game init method
   - Added update method calls in the game loop
   - Implemented resource cleanup in dispose method

3. Time of Day presets:
   - Dawn: Warm orange/pink tones with low-angle lighting
   - Day: Standard lighting with medium fog
   - Dusk: Dark orange/red sunset lighting with increased fog
   - Night: Dark blue tones with low ambient light and moon-like directional light

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Low quality: Higher fog density (shorter view distance), no dust particles, no dynamic lighting
   - Medium quality: Medium fog density, reduced dust particles, dynamic lighting
   - High quality: Lower fog density (longer view distance), full dust particles, dynamic lighting

The atmospheric effects greatly enhance the apocalyptic feel of the zombie shooter game, creating a tense and immersive environment for gameplay.

## Developer Notes
Implementation required careful balancing of visual quality and performance. The dust particle system had to be optimized to prevent performance issues, and the flickering light effect needed to be subtle enough not to be distracting while still contributing to the atmosphere.

Future enhancements could include advanced weather effects (rain, thunder), day/night cycle, and more detailed skybox with volumetric clouds.
