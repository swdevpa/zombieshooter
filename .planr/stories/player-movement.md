# User Story: Implement player movement and collision detection

## Description
As a player, I want to move around the game world using WASD keys and have proper collision detection, so that I can navigate the environment without walking through objects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Player can move forward, backward, left, and right using WASD keys
- Movement is relative to camera direction (camera-relative movement)
- Player collision detection prevents walking through walls and other obstacles
- Proper physics-like movement with acceleration and deceleration
- Player maintains a consistent height above the ground
- Movement feels smooth and responsive

## Developer Notes
The implementation of the player movement and collision detection system has been completed with the following enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Collision Detection**:
   - Implemented a hybrid collision system that uses both raycasting and sphere-box collision techniques
   - Added directional collision response that only zeroes out velocity in the direction of collision
   - Made collision detection more efficient by focusing on city buildings rather than traversing the entire scene

2. **Improved City Generation**:
   - Modified building generation to create better-defined building meshes with proper bounding boxes
   - Implemented a grid-based system for quickly identifying building locations
   - Added helper methods to check if a position intersects with buildings

3. **Game Integration**:
   - Enhanced the connection between the player and city components
   - Added automatic marking of collidable objects in the city
   - Set player start position based on city layout

4. **Physics Improvements**:
   - Refined the acceleration and deceleration to provide smoother movement
   - Improved handling of boundary checks to keep player within the game world

All acceptance criteria have been met, and the player can now navigate the procedurally generated city environment with smooth movement and accurate collision detection.
