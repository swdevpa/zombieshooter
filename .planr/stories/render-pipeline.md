# Story: Profile and Optimize Render Pipeline

## Description
As a developer, I need to profile and optimize the game's render pipeline to ensure optimal performance across different hardware. This involves identifying bottlenecks, implementing render pipeline optimizations, and creating a system to dynamically adjust rendering techniques based on performance metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement a RenderManager class to centralize rendering logic
- [x] Add detailed render pipeline profiling metrics to identify bottlenecks
- [x] Implement render batching and instancing where appropriate
- [x] Add frame time breakdown for different render stages
- [x] Optimize shader usage and material management
- [x] Implement render queue sorting for optimal pipeline usage
- [x] Add dynamic resolution scaling based on performance
- [x] Create debug visualization tools for render pipeline analysis
- [x] Ensure compatibility with existing systems (CullingManager, LODManager)
- [x] Update UI to display relevant render pipeline metrics
- [x] Optimize post-processing effects with quality presets

## Technical Notes
The current rendering approach is scattered throughout the Game class and lacks centralized management. Creating a dedicated RenderManager will help organize the code, improve testability, and provide better hooks for optimization. 

The game should maintain 60+ FPS on mid-range hardware with appropriate quality settings. Render pipeline optimization should focus on:

1. Reducing draw calls through batching and instancing
2. Optimizing shader complexity and material usage
3. Implementing efficient render queue sorting
4. Adding dynamic resolution scaling
5. Optimizing post-processing effects

## Developer Notes
Implemented a comprehensive RenderManager class that centralizes all rendering functionality:

1. Post-Processing Pipeline:
   - Added EffectComposer with render pass, FXAA anti-aliasing, and bloom effects
   - Created quality presets that adjust effect parameters based on hardware capability
   - Implemented toggle system for enabling/disabling effects based on performance needs

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Implemented dynamic resolution scaling that automatically adjusts render resolution based on frame time
   - Created render queue sorting for both opaque objects (front-to-back) and transparent objects (back-to-front)
   - Added detailed performance metrics for total frame time, scene rendering time, culling time, and post-processing time
   - Integrated with existing CullingManager for optimal visibility determination

3. Debugging Tools:
   - Added a debug overlay that displays real-time rendering statistics
   - Implemented F9 keyboard shortcut to toggle debug visualization mode
   - Created frame time breakdown to identify rendering bottlenecks

4. Quality Presets:
   - Implemented four quality presets (low, medium, high, ultra) with appropriate settings
   - Adjusted post-processing parameters, resolution scaling, and rendering techniques for each preset
   - Ensured consistent visual quality across different hardware capabilities

5. Integration:
   - Refactored Game.js to use the new RenderManager
   - Updated the animation loop to use the centralized render method
   - Ensured compatibility with existing managers (CullingManager, LODManager)
   - Created proper disposal methods for cleaning up resources

The new rendering system significantly improves performance by:
- Reducing draw calls through better sorting and batching
- Scaling resolution dynamically to maintain frame rate
- Optimizing post-processing effects based on hardware capability
- Providing detailed metrics for further optimization

These improvements help maintain 60+ FPS on mid-range hardware with appropriate quality settings while still maintaining visual fidelity.
