## Description
Create a robust procedural building generation system that produces varied, realistic buildings for the zombie apocalypse cityscape. The system should support different building types, architectural styles, and levels of destruction to create a compelling post-apocalyptic environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create a modular building generation system that produces varied building structures
- Implement at least 3 different building types (residential, commercial, industrial)
- Buildings should have appropriate architectural details (windows, doors, rooftops)
- Support for different levels of destruction/damage for apocalyptic appearance
- Buildings should be efficiently rendered with proper geometry and materials
- Buildings must work with the existing collision system
- Implementation should follow the established modular architecture
- System must work with the culling system for optimal performance

## Technical Notes
- Use Three.js geometry and materials for building components
- Implement a procedural texture system for building facades
- Use object instancing for repeated elements (windows, doors) to improve performance
- Ensure proper LOD (Level of Detail) implementation for distant buildings
- Optimize geometry to reduce vertex count while maintaining visual quality

## Developer Notes
Implemented a comprehensive procedural building generation system with the following features:

1. Created a new BuildingGenerator class that manages the creation of three building types:
   - Residential buildings with balconies, windows, and sloped roofs
   - Commercial buildings with storefronts and regular window patterns
   - Industrial buildings with large doors, smokestacks, and tanks

2. Implemented four levels of destruction for apocalyptic atmosphere:
   - Pristine (undamaged)
   - Damaged (broken windows, minor damage)
   - Heavily Damaged (structural cracks, holes in walls)
   - Partially Collapsed (major structural failure with rubble)

3. Added building details like:
   - Windows with appropriate placement based on building type
   - Doors and entrances positioned on building facades
   - Balconies for residential buildings
   - Industrial details like smokestacks and tanks
   - Different roof styles per building type

4. Integrated with the existing City class for seamless generation:
   - Building types are distributed logically (more commercial in center, industrial in outskirts)
   - Destruction levels increase toward city edges for realistic apocalyptic atmosphere
   - Buildings maintain collision detection compatibility

5. Performance optimizations:
   - Shared material system with caching by building type and destruction level
   - Geometry templates for repeated elements
   - Bounding box collision data for efficient collision detection

The system produces more visually interesting and varied buildings that enhance the post-apocalyptic atmosphere while maintaining good performance.
