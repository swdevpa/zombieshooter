# Advanced Lighting Effects

## Description
Implement advanced lighting effects in the game to enhance the visual atmosphere and realism of the zombie wave shooter.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement dynamic lighting system with ambient, directional, and point lights
- [x] Add shadows for buildings, zombies, and player
- [x] Create atmospheric light effects (god rays, lens flares)
- [x] Implement dynamic time-of-day lighting changes
- [x] Add player light sources (flashlight, weapon muzzle flash)
- [x] Ensure lighting system is optimized for performance
- [x] Integrate lighting quality settings with existing quality presets
- [x] Create flickering light effects for immersive atmosphere
- [x] Add emergency lighting in buildings
- [x] Implement light-based gameplay mechanics (zombies react to light)

## Implementation Notes
- Create a LightingManager class to centralize lighting management
- Use Three.js lighting and shadow capabilities
- Implement light culling for better performance
- Ensure compatibility with existing culling and LOD systems
- Add light map baking option for low-end devices

## Developer Notes
Implemented a comprehensive LightingManager class to handle all dynamic lighting effects in the game. Key features include:

1. Created a modular lighting system with three types of lights (point lights, spot lights, and emergency lights) for different effects.
2. Added player flashlight with toggle control (F key) and realistic positioning/movement.
3. Implemented weapon muzzle flash lighting that activates when firing weapons.
4. Created flickering emergency lights in buildings with randomized parameters for atmospheric effect.
5. Integrated lighting quality settings with the game's quality presets to ensure optimal performance on different hardware.
6. Implemented light culling based on distance and visibility to maintain high frame rates.
7. Added light debug mode (L key) to visualize light positions and properties during development.
8. Connected lighting system with existing weapon mechanics for muzzle flash effects when shooting.
9. Implemented proper shadow mapping for all lights with configurable resolution based on quality settings.
10. Added dynamic lighting effects that respond to player actions and game events.
